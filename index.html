   Recirculating aquaculture systems or RAS fish farming methods are used in home aquarium.
   And the RAS fish farming systems are also used for fish production where water exchange is limited and the
    use of biofiltration is required for reducing toxicity.
    Other types of environmental control and filtration are

    system+design&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjviv_61tjpAhWxzjg --> often also necessary for maintaining clean water
    and for providing a suitable habitat for the fish.Tthe main advantage of RAS fish farming 
    system is the ability to reduce the need for fresh and clean water while still maintaining a healthy
    environment for fish.<br>
    The RAS fish farming system must have high fish stocking densities to be operated economically and 
    commercially. Many researchers are currently conducting studies for determining if RAS fish farming 
    is a viable form of intensive aquaculture. Currently, is one of the fastest growing sectors in 
    agriculture because of the growing demand for protein-rich food. And farming fish commercially can
     be a great way for earning some extra cash. RAS fish farming system can be a very good way for 
     earning some extras. <br> <br>

RAS fish farming system design <br>
 <font size="5" face="times new roman" color="black"> <p>

The main system has a simple design which consists of fish tanks,mechanical filter, biofilter,
 trickling filter or degrasser, oxygen enrichment unit and UV disinfector. You also need some extra
 facilities such as pH regulator, heat exchange unit, denitrification unit etc.<br></p></font>

The basic operating principle of these systems that the water from the fish tank moves through the mechanical 
filter and then through biological filter [the water is stripped of carbon dioxide before getting 
aerated and is returned back to the fish tanks.]

<font size="6" font="algerian" color="black">Required tank size for RAS fish farming</strong></font> <br>

<font size="5" face="times new roman" color="black"><p class="intro2">
    The tanks used for RAS fish farming system can be of any size and shape.
    The tank can be rectangular, circular, oval etc. Mostly the circular or oval tanks are preffered for 
    RAS fish farming system, because they are easier to clean and also facilitate easy water circulation 
    when compared to rectangular tanks. size of the tanks can vary from 500 gallons to 500k gallons 
    depending on the available facilities. The capacity of the tank depends on the factors like type of 
    fish, stocking rate, water requirement and quality.<!--marquee="img src-designing aherf @.. 
    jpeg,fif,webp,"strong" <p ntro @style css "u"
--> the materials which are used for making the tanks 
    can be wood, glass, rubber, metal, concrete or plastic. <br> <br>
    Today, most of the modern tanks are being constructed with outlets that
     have optimal waste removal capacity and are fitted with suitable mesh screens.
      These outlets should also make removal of dead fish easy. 
      Raceway tanks are also used which is a blend of circular and rectangular shapes. 
    These tanks have a wall in the center for faciliating circulation.

    Flow of water and pumps
</font>
<font size="5" face="times new roman" color="black"><p>

    There should be a constant flow of water in RAS fish farming system, and there should be
     a possibility to alter the speed, pressure and direction depending on the requirement.
      Generally the movement of water is controlled through gravitation and before it is used in the 
      system, the water is generally pumped to an elevation from where it begins to flow.
      Generally the centrifugal pump is most commonly used in the RAS fish farming system. 
      Usually the pump is placed outside the tank and operates at a high pressure.
</p>
</font>
<font size="6" font="algerian" color="black">Mechanical filters</font>
<font size="5" face="times new roman" color="black"><p>
    Mechanical filters are required for removing the waste from the fish tank. Currently,
     modern recirculating systems have an outlet with a filter called the micro screen of mesh
      size 40 to 100 microns. The presence of the micro screen has some
       advantages such as it reduces the load on biofilter,
     removes the organic impurities and improves or facilitates the biofiltration process.
</p> </font>
<font size="6" font="algerian" color="black">
    Biofilters
</font>
<font size="5" face="times new roman" color="black"><p>

    Biofilters are the most important component of RAS fish farming system, because it helps 
    in removing the fine pollutants from water during waste treatment.
     The biofilters are generally made up of materials like plastic sheets, 
     beads, gravel, sand and lava rock.

     A simple biofilter can be a wheel, barrel or box filled with media on
      which nitrifying bacteria grow. It can be made of plastic, grass, metal, 
      wood or concrete. And the size of the biofilter defines the fish caring capacity of the 
      entire system.<br>

Biofiltration can be done effectively only if the temperature and 
pH level of the water are regulated properly. The minimum temperature
 of the water should be between 10°C and 35°C, and the pH range should be between 7 and 8. 
 Low and high pH level may
 result in inefficiency of the filter and higher toxic effect respectively.
</p>
</font>
<font size="6" font="algerian" color="black">
    Sump for waste collection
</font>
<font size="5" face="times new roman" color="black"><p>

    The presence of waste in the tank decreases the amount of dissolved oxygen content 
    in water and increases the demand for oxygen (thereby lowering the density of fish in the tank).
     So a sump or a clarifier tank is used for collecting the excess waste at a slow rate.
     The shape of the sump should be of V shape so as to facilitate easy cleaning.
</p>
</font>
<font size="6" font="algerian" color="black">
Degrassing
</font>
<font size="5" face="times new roman" color="black"><p>

    Accumulated gases in the fish tank should be cleared by providing proper aeration. And this
     method is called stripping. Supplying air into the tanks can drive the gases away through turbulence. 
    And a trickling filter system is often used for this process.
</p></font>
<font size="6" font="algerian" color="black">
    Aeration or oxygenation
</font>
<font size="5" face="times new roman" color="black"><p>


    Providing oxygen supply to the water in the tanks is called aeration. Cool and warm water
     recirculating systems need 6 and 8 ppm oxygen respectively for bacteria and fish to survive.
      The tanks which have high load carrying capacity should be able to replace oxygen every 20 to
       30 minutes. So there should be a proper and regular supply of oxygen otherwise it could lead to 
       loss of fish and also there should be a back up. Blowing air through a submerged air stone is the
        commonly used method for aerating the tank. If you can provide sufficient aeration, 
    then there is no need for a distinct carbon dioxide stripping unit.
</p> </font>
<font size="6" font="algerian" color="black">
    Types of Wastes
</font>
<font size="5" face="times new roman" color="black"><p>
    The solid wastes present in the tank can be divided into 3 types. Here we are describing more about
     these 3 types and also their removal methods.
</p>
<font size="6" font="algerian" color="black">
    Ammonia and nitrate toxins
</font>
<font size="5" face="times new roman" color="black"><ul>
    Ammonia and nitrate toxins occur in two forms; ionized ammonium and free ammonia.<br>
Can cause brown blood disease in the fish.<br>
Sometimes also present in the form of ammonia nitrate.<br>
Nitrate concentration should be below 0.5 mg/l.<br>
Can be prevented by adding 1 pound of salt to 120 gallons of water.<br></ul>

<font size="6" font="algerian" color="black">
    Settleable waste
</font>
<font size="5" face="times new roman" color="black"><ul>

<li>Removed into a sump.</li>
<li>Can also be removed by suspending them in an exterior settling tank.</li>
<li>Some waste can be removed from the surface depending on the flow rate.</li>
<li>Modern way of removal is ECo-TRAPTM which uses a plate at the bottom of the tank to separate the wastes.</li>
</ul>
<font size="6" font="algerian" color="black">
Suspended and dissolved wastes</font>
<font size="5" face="times new roman" color="black"><ul>
    <li>Requires screen filters or media filters for removing wastes.</li>
    <li> Foam fractionation, rotating microscreens, biofiltration, moving
     bed filters and floating bed filters are some methods for removing wastes.<br></li></ul>
     <font size="6" font="algerian" color="black">
        Nitrification</font>

        <font size="5" face="times new roman" color="black"><p>

            The process of detoxifying ammonia is called nitrification. Converting ammonia nitrogen to
             less toxic nitrogen dioxide and finally
             to non-toxic nitrate through bacterial action is the principal of nitrification.</p>
        </font>
        <font size="6" font="algerian" color="black">
            De-nitrification</font>

<font size="5" face="times new roman" color="black"><p>
    The end production of nitrification process is nitrate and is non-toxic in nature, but the
     presence of nitrate beyond 100 mg/l has a negative impact on the growth of the fish and feed 
     conversion. Supplying fresh water regularly to the tank can keep the levels of nitrate low.
      But the main aim of recirculating system is to maintain or lower the water consumption rate.
     Therefore a process called de-nitrification is adopted.
    <br>The de-nitrification process is required if the supply of water is less than 300 litters per 
    kg of feed. The minimum amount of methanol required for de-nitrification is 1 kg of nitrogen is
     about 2.5 kg. The de-nitrifying chamber 
    is fitted to the biofilter with residence time of 2 to 4 hours.
</p> </font>
     <font size="6" font="algerian" color="black">
        Balancing pH
     </font>
     <font size="5" face="times new roman" color="black"><p>
        The pH level of the water should be maintained to a balanced ratio for ensuring the fish to 
        survive well. The tolerable range or limit of the pH level is between 6 and 9.5. pH of the RAS 
        fish farming system can be maintained by adding buffers
         like sodium bicarbonate and calcium bicarbonate.</p></font>
         <font size="6" font="algerian" color="black">
            Feeding the fish
         </font>
         <font size="5" face="times new roman" color="black"><p>
            You should provide feed in accordance to the growth, body weight and activity of your fish.
             On average you should feed your fish with 4%-5% food daily of their total body weight. For          example, if the total body weight of the fishes is 100 kg, then you should provide your fish 
      with 4 to 5 kg foods daily. Provide the feeds twice a day. 2-2.5 kg at morning and another 2-2.5 kg 
     during evening. Always try to feed your fish with high quality feeds.
     You can also purchase the ready-made commercial fish feeds.
</p></font>
<font size="6" font="algerian" color="black">
    Types of fishes are suitable for RAS fish farming
</font>
<font size="5" face="times new roman" color="black"><p>

Recycled water is much warmer than natural water. And cold water fish species such as
 salmon are not good for RAS fish farming system. Barramundi, carp fishes, perch, catfish,
  pangasius, white fish, tilapia, blue fin tuna, rainbow trout, seabass and 
sturgeion are very good for RAS fish farming system.</p></font>

Stocking density</font>
<font size="5" face="times new roman" color="black"><p>
    It is important to keep the production of fish in line with the capacity of the RAS fish
     farming system. Many methods are used for avoiding overloading of the system with heavy stocking density.
     Some of the methods are mentioned here;</p>
     <ul>
   <li>The fingerlings are not grown to market size fish in the same tank. 
       Instead you should use separate tanks.</li>
        <li>The fishes grown to an intermediate size are graded and moved to another tank.</li>
       <li> Before introducing the fingerlings into growth system tanks, quarantine tanks are used for them.
         Both quarantine and growth tanks are physically isolated.</li>
     </ul>
     <font size="6" font="algerian" color="black">
     Monitoring and controlling</font>
     <font size="5" face="times new roman" color="black"><p>

        Fish farming can be properly done only if there is a regulated control and monitoring system within 
        the RAS fish farming system. A central system for controlling and monitoring of certain
         features like oxygen levels, pH range, water levels and other functions is deployed for 
         efficient handling of the system. You can install and use automatic sensors or alarms for
          indicating when a problem arises.
These are the common RAS fish farming systems. If you don’t have enough space for making earthen 
or natural pond, then you can try this system for fish farming.
